1. File System Organizer



* Objective: Create a script that organizes files in a directory into subdirectories based on file type.
* Core Modules: fs for file operations, path for handling file paths.
* Concepts Covered: Reading directories, moving files, asynchronous programming.


### 2. Command-Line Tool



* Objective: Develop a command-line tool that can perform tasks like converting CSV files to JSON, merging multiple text files into one, or generating summaries from logs.
* Core Modules: fs, readline.
* Concepts Covered: Stream handling, command-line input/output, event-driven programming.


### 3. Local Backup Solution



* Objective: Build a tool that periodically backs up specified directories to another location on the same machine or an external drive.
* Core Modules: fs, path, os, events.
* Concepts Covered: File system monitoring, scheduling tasks, handling events.


### 4. Network Request Logger



* Objective: Create a simple network server that logs all incoming requests with their headers and payloads to a file.
* Core Modules: http, fs, url.
* Concepts Covered: Creating HTTP servers, handling HTTP requests, logging data.


### 5. System Health Monitor



* Objective: Develop a script that monitors certain system health metrics (like CPU load, memory usage) and logs them or alerts if certain thresholds are exceeded.
* Core Modules: os, fs, events.
* Concepts Covered: Accessing system information, real-time monitoring, working with events.


### 6. File Encryption Tool



* Objective: Create a tool that encrypts and decrypts files using a given key.

* Concepts Covered: File manipulation, encryption and decryption, working with binary data.


### 7. Markdown to HTML Converter



* Objective: Build a simple converter that takes Markdown files and converts them to HTML files.
* Core Modules: fs, path.
* Concepts Covered: File reading and writing, text processing.
* Project Setup and Execution


### For any of these projects:



* Initialize a Node.js Project: Use npm init to start a new project, setting up a package.json file.
* Project Structure: Organize your code into modules where applicable, separating concerns and making use of Node.js's modular nature.
* Debugging and Testing: Utilize Node.jsâ€™s built-in assert module for basic testing or use a more comprehensive testing framework to ensure your code works as expected.
* These projects will help you explore the depth of Node.js's capabilities beyond web applications, touching on various aspects like file handling, network communications, system information, and security. Each project can be scaled up with additional features as you get more comfortable with the basics.
